# Game Of Fifteen

A very basic interpretation of the classic Game Of Fifteen. This was an opening assignment for a course on Object Oriented Applications at Chalmers University.

## Getting Started

To launch the app, simply compile and run the GameOfFifteen file.

### About the project

I used a template for the game-logic given from Chalmers (GameGenerator.java). The GUI is the good ole Java Swing library.
